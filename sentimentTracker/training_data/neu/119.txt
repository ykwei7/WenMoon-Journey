From a financial standpoint HIMS seems better situated then 90% of Spacs that have come to market which caught my attention. But what's holding me back from pulling the trigger is the level of competition. Brands like Keeps or Roman are more well known to me and there are a bunch more in this space. What differentiates or gives HIMS a sustainable competitive advantage?
