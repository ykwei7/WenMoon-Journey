For WMT, I am assuming there are positive scenarios to unfold.  One is the increase in revenue growth (now over 5%) will lead to faster dividend growth.  The second is big players will increasingly move to safer large caps like WMT as overall market growth slows.  Either scenario, or both, will send share price higher.  (nearly all stocks have insiders selling)
