It’s a hard thing to read, firstly AMD isn’t a semiconductor stock, they don’t make any of their own chips like intel does. Secondly intel still owns a huge portion of the enterprise space and can easily take hold of that if they come out with a decent answer to epyc. All in all I would be more worried bout AMD, they are completely reliant on actual semi conductor companies. If intel can come up with a decent 7nm process and keep hold of enterprise I see it and AMD stabilizing round similiar prices.
