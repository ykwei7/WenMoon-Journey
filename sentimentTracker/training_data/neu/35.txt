There\`s really no benefit of 24/7 trading. My brocker (not U.S.) enables me to trade stocks and ETFs from 7:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. But having some movement all day long is just annoying. You just check your portfolio more often. Prices are set during the opening hours of the major stock exchanges not in Pre or Aftermarket.
