> then why would they focus solely on software?

Because that's where the money is. Self driving car vs. human driven car is the same leap that there is between home refrigerator and having to buy ice at the store.

Tesla having better margins than other OEMs is basically some guy positioning the store 500ft closer to you and undercutting competition by the aforementioned 500ft. We have been making cars for 150 years now...we are really looking at very small further improvements in productivity and margins. Such improvements can't even be protected with patents or by having very few people knowing what is going on and showering them in cash to keep their mouth shut. 

The whole world already knows how Tesla plans to have better margins: vertical intergration...it's not a mistery, and it can be replicated if proven a winning strategy

Point is that nobody has infinite money, not even lord Musk...you want to pay the smartest people on Earth to enable to work them on this very hard problem, find a solution to it, retain the IP and sell the service to other automakers, which is what Waymo and Zoox are doing.

You don't want to waste money manufacturing stuff.

There is an argument I suppose that you have to build the car to sell people the excitement for a selfdriving car and then they'd reward you by buying the stock and providing you the funding to make that  car or the following models actually self-driving . This is the approach that Musk is taking....but honestly I don't know about that...even retail investors which are targeted  by Musk massive PR campaigns have no problem investing in abstract stuff such as Palantir or Cryptocurrencies and NFTs, ICOs etc. 

So I think if Waymo were to spinoff and become a public company with a CEO just as promotional as Musk is, I think they'd be able to pump the stock and raise funds exactly like Tesla and without the tangible produtct.
