Amazon as a competitor is overblown. The majority of people filling meds are the elderly who typically avoid technology and prefer the more traditional approach to picking up in stores. Plus, a lot of meds can be considered time sensitive, so having to wait for delivery is an issue. Not to mention, what happens when meds are lost in deluvery? A lot of patients early during the pandemic had meds lost and refuse delivery. 

I can see Amazon taking market share from healthy, young patients who need things like birth control and antidepressants though.
