If you're still buying the exact same businesses either way then the risk doesn't change. If you just buy a couple individual stocks vs buying a bunch of them in an ETF then obviously your risk is different because your holdings are different. You need to figure out if your objective is to own specific companies or to just own whatever is in the ETF. It sounds like you're scared of buying Chinese stocks, in which case you should stay away from them. If the Chinese government does something that tanks stock prices it doesn't matter if you hold them through an ETF or not.
