So, again, you are just looking at the front facing numbers and not digging in. If we look at cash flow from operations, they did +$1.6B in Q1, which is the worst quarter. The cash to debt, not assets to liabilities, cash to debt is >1.

If we look at just these numbers, they can pay off debt tomorrow, stop expanding, and generate $1.6B of cash during their worst quarter of the year.

I'm not saying they should do that, it's just a quick dig through the numbers to look at the core business in its current state. It's a very profitable company, saying otherwise is willfully ignoring everything that doesn't align with your thesis.

The capital raises are allowing them to grow faster, but they weren't needed. The raises always happened after a large rally and the growth had been planned before then.
