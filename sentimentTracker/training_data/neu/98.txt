First of all, best wishes for your health.

I am non-US, older than you, but with my little experience: have you already bought these many fashionable and hence pricey stocks?

I avoid ETF's and have: British equity fund (around 70% US stocks) [fundsmith.co.uk](https://fundsmith.uk) , German mid-small cap and rent property funds, stocks: Uranium, Copper, Coal (Thungela Resources https://twitter.com/hkuppy) and planning to buy Japanese Itochu Corporation stock ([lynalden.com](https://lynalden.com)).

Each stock: around 1% of available money, aim maximum 10 to 12 stocks and cash for emergency/buying if something really good comes across the way.

And physical precious metals and bit of BTC.

Basically, generally, don't go where the crowd goes (too costly).

Best of luck.
