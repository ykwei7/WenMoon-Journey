While I can not accurately predict the future I am very certain neither AAPL nor MSFT will return 400%+ the next five years. For that to happen you'd need to either assume ridiculous future PE valuations or growth way beyond what any professional analyst expects. 

Overall, finding 4x+ investments, even on a five year basis, is *very* hard. High returns usually come with high risk. Even if some of your picks perform very well, you should expect some to stagnate, underperform or tank, seriously impacting your average return. I admire your effort to outperform but you should expect reasonable returns somewhat similar to the market not 5x in 5 years.

Edit: I just read the least paragraph of your post and wanted to add that I wish you all the best with your medical condition! Still, especially with your shortened time horizon, you should invest responsible. I would recommend to read about value investing (which does not contradict growth) and efficient market theory. Based on the research of many people, some of them probably being way smarter than anybody in this sub, you should consider re-evaluating your strategy according to your chances to outperform and the associated risks.
