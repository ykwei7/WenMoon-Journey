Honestly, when I first replied you were at -1, and I upvoted to help it not go into the hole it is in now. I thought your arguments were justified for what it's worth.

>people are worried about stocks being at ATH, why would I spend $700 on a share when may are expecting a crash? Not to disagree with much of anything that you say here, chip makers are the future IMO and as chip production ramps up I think we will see many chip producers outperform.
