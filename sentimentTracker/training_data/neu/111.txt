Not if you're looking for quick fat gains, Nintendo has been historically a slow and steady type of company, they have tons of cash to help them through tough times (Wii U type situations) but they don't structure their company for aggressive growth. 

Great company if you just want to park your money into the video game industry, they've also been experimenting more with mobile releases which should slowly but consistently increase their revenue.
