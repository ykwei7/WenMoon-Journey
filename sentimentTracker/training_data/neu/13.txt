What has changed fundamentally about the stock that makes you want to sell? If you bought at a higher price and nothing has changed then you should want to buy even more at the lower price.

Like you said it’s a long term play so you need to be comfortable holding and adding more through times like this. I personally have a large position in PLTR and I love this dip. Just more cheap shares for the distant future.
