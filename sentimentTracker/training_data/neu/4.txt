I'm not expecting a crash at all, but there's nothing wrong with being hesitant to put large amounts of money into a single share of a company. Especially if people have other expenses and can't throw $700 into a single share every month (on top of their retirement portfolio, I hope)
Of course r/investing has long term/retirement in mind so I'm not really worried about the people here, but thinking outside of this subreddit, I don't know many who has the money to invest in it
