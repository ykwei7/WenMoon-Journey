Anyone who thinks Tesla is just like the traditional auto companies needs to do a bit more research (no shade, just saying that it’s not that simple). It’s similar to how people thought Amazon was just a retailer, but turns out AWS is actually worth a ton. 

For instance, Toyota does not install grid storage batteries, own fueling stations, install solar, or have the 5th largest supercomputer with ~several billion miles of highly detailed driving data.
