You're missing the point. Tesla used to be priced for a decent degree of failure, decent chance of being a solid auto maker, small chance of being a huge force. Now it's priced as though there's no risk to the former, it'll for sure be a huge player in the future. Now maybe that's right, but even in that case there isn't anything for the stock to grow into. And if they ever stumble, if Musk suddenly dies, another maker steals their lunch or a new standard for chargers comes out, etc then there is huge downside.
