Agree, didn’t mean to imply this quarter signaled the turn around is starting to work.  They did avoid another large disappointment and restate commitment to making a turn around.  Just meant to say that I’ll remain skeptical and want to see at least 1-2 years of improved quarters, if that ever happens, before considering investing in INTC again.  Risk to the downside too great otherwise, given their culture, history, management, board, and competition.
