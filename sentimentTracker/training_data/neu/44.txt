For perspective, Tesla is trying to solve self-driving with computer vision. Every Tesla on the road has its software running in the background, feeding the 5th most powerful computer in the world. There, the AI is trained by comparing driver decisions to the decisions it would have made on its own.

With each vehicle doubling as a data collection device, if any company out there is going to solve self-driving (if it is even possible), it is going to be Tesla. It's not going to be Waymo, nothing out of China, nothing out of Uber or Lyft, and certainly nothing from the traditional car manufacturers. The competition cannot match the sheer magnitude of data that Tesla has collected and continues to collect, and it will be done using only pure vision (cameras), and not with any LIDAR.
