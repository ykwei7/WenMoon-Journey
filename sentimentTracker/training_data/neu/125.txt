I've traded INTC for decades.  This year that ended.  Seeing them flounder for so many years, but the worst was when I saw how easily Apple's first stab at a laptop chip spanked Intel.  That tells me the emperor's clothes are thin.  If rookie Apple can beat them, Intel should be shuddering at what Nvidia and AMD can do.

Another factor for me was their dumb choice of an accountant as CEO when it was obvious to all that their biggest problems were all related to a vacuum of technology and engineering leadership.  Yes, they've since replaced him, but that chapter to me their board is useless.
