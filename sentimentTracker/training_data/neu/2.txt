Thanks, I still stand by it. Sure the people here (r/investing) have the money to drop $500+ at a time, but people in their early and mid 20’s like myself, have many other expenses where they can’t. That’s not to say that this isn’t a good or bad stock choice, I just commented what I thought was a logical opinion. Guess no one liked it lol
