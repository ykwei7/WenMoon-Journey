This argument makes no sense to me. You're really going to ignore $4.5 billion of revenue? You're honestly going to ignore 14% of a company's revenue just because it's not the majority source?

In what world does this make sense? That's like saying Microsoft is only a cloud storage company and ignoring Windows revenue.
