2x/3x (leverage) is a good tool when used correctly (and on a bull run). So far UPRO & TQQQ is the standard paired with 1x stuff (QQQ, SPY, VTI) or bonds (e.g. TMF)

I'm more a fan of UPRO since it's a much broader/stable ETF in the long run, and S&P500 holdings haven't disappoint

P.S: Btw if you guys want to checkout there are examples of **2x Mutual Funds by Rydex** running **since the 2000s that survived** (the dotcom/2008s)

* [RYTNX](https://www.google.com/search?q=rytnx) for 2x S&P500 (which is pretty stable after dotcom), and the motherload 
* [RYVYX](https://www.google.com/search?q=ryvyx) for 2x Invesco's QQQ (which recently recovered from the 2000s ATH, lol)
