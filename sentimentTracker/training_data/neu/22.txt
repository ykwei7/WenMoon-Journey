I think you’re answering your own question, if you have concern about another country’s volatility due to government regulation, then minimize your risk by reducing holdings in that country. I think having some exposure to one of the largest economy in the world via an ETF like VWO is safer (57.6% holdings in China + Taiwan), so long as you’re mitigating risk by diversification outside of emerging markets.
