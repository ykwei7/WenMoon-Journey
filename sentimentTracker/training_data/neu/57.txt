They are growing at about 50% YOY... that's not significant? Or you mean share price? In that case, be prepared to be shocked...Tesla has already won, you just have to look at the writing on the wall. They are years ahead in terms of technology and processes...years in tech is a lifetime. The gap is getting bigger, not smaller.  I don't think they will 6x again anytime soon but the long term growth will continue at exponential rates for at least 5 more years
