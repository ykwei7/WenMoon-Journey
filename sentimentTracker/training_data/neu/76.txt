You're getting into a different discussion, we're addressing "is Tesla just a car company".

But to address your argument, Tesla does have operating cash flow, in the billions. It seems like you are just looking at the face value numbers and not digging in. The only reason FCF isn't positive, is because they are investing a ton back into the company. They are currently expanding to double production and you are acting like that's a bad thing, because "negative cash flow".
