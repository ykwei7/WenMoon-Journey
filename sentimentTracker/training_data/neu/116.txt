There are 2x mutual funds by Rydex that has been running since the 2000s (and seen the dotcom + 2008):

* [RYTNX](https://www.google.com/search?q=rytnx) for 2x S&P500 (even if you invested ATH, it kinda performed like a normal SPY)
* [RYVYX](https://www.google.com/search?q=ryvyx)for 2x QQQ (which took 20 years to recover... in 2021; but if you invested/DCA after the crash... it's good)

DCA-ing or moving in after a crash/bear (+ rebalancing with bonds)... is a pretty good move
