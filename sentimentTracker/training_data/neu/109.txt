I think the “91% of employees approve of the CEO” is outdated information. The recent corporate and store level re-structures have left the corporate team decimated and struggling to accomplish basic work functions, and store employees are frustrated. Anyone I speak with at BBY from either level does not have many great things to say about Barry.

I love a lot of things about BBY, but I’m holding off on buying more shares until the dust settles to see if the changes they’re making do in fact set them up for long-term success, or if these changes are a pendulum swing in a questionable direction. Have you been inside an updated Best Buy? They look great, but it took me 45min to get an employee to help me find the 2 small components I was looking for.
