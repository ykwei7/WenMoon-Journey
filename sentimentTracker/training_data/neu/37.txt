I'm not asking about a ETF that is traded a lot during after hours, I'm talking about an ETF that tracks a lot of things are are traded a lot more on average than other stocks after hours. After hours when the market is closed, that's usually it for the day for my portfolio. I don't get anything else aside from the rare occasional slight changes of a few cents.   


The benefit of that ETF would be that I can "make some profit while I sleep". For example, would you rather portfolio A that, after the markets close, rarely changes, and if it does, it goes up/down a few cents, or would you rather portfolio B which would have such an ETF, that, after the markets close, is still doing stuff and making some money? It has nothing to do with the trading itself or the ETF itself, just the stocks that are more traded after hours.   


This is why I said, that if you have stocks like AAPL, MFST, and SPCE, and let's say they're traded on average more after hours (even if they aren't). Then let's have, 100 or so other stocks that are also traded more after hours in that ETF too. That would mean, since this ETF tracks stocks that are more likely to be traded after hours, it's more likely that my portfolio will be doing more after hours than normally.
