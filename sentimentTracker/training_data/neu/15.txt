Not bullish on PLTR but like others have said, 10% swing at this stage is not meaningful because there is very little in ways of fundamentals... or more accurately, the fundamentals do not reflect their IPO's valuation and wont for a very long time. Whether they succeed or not is a matter of your personal opinion. I prefer to wait before investing in companies like this. For example, I didnt get into Tesla till 2019. But some folks like to take big risks and thats fine.  

Bottom line is you are riding the speculative wave. 10-50% swings are likely to happen in any direction. Thats a given for most IPO's in their early years.
