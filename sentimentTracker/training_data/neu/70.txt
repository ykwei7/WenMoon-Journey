Data capturing and battery marketshare will be some of the two most underestimated characteristics that Tesla will hold in the markets. Tesla's vehicles record more data than any other vehicle in the world right now, that I'm aware of, and whoever has the most data wins. Look at Google. Of course, what you're able to execute on with said data matters, but knowing that everyone graduating school now wants to work at SpaceX and Tesla means they get the brightest minds for awhile. Again, just like Google did over a decade ago. If Tesla can execute on their AI Vision for the robotaxi's I really can't see how any of this lidar and radar stuff will even compete. It's like terminator vs a toaster at that point (sure I'm exaggerating, but research it and you'll see the potential).

IF they can continue to grow and have some kind of marketshare dominance with their vehicles AND own the back end of battery life by recycling batteries into the powergrid they become the energy giant also. This is what people miss about Tesla. They try to put them into a category when no one has ever been able to do all these things before! Whether anyone is a fan or not it really is interesting to see what these amazing minded people are accomplishing in such a short period of time. Truly, hats off to the amazing workers designing these technologies. Great to read all these comments and analysis.
