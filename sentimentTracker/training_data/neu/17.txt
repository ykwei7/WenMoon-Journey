If I take my kid to the doctor and get a prescription then I want it that day, not 2 days later in the mail.  I don’t see Amazon doing anything Walmart’s pharmacy doesn’t already do. Mailing prescriptions are already a thing I can get so I’m not sure what Amazon’s competitive advantage is, esp since cost is mostly dependent on insurance copays not cost. 

I’m not sure really where Amazon would put a huge dent into their business. Automatic refills sent to your house free with Prime might make me consider it, but I’d always want a Walgreens (esp 24 hour pharmacies) close by in an emergency.
