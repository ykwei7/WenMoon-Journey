Then the underlying loses value and you still lose. That's why. Why don't you have 50k in a stock and make $2k a week? Or 5k and make 200 a week? I sell CC's on qqq for about $150-200 a week with over 100k position... It's not ex money. If it works all the time people would be retiring with 50k lol.
