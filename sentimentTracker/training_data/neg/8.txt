Not sure what I was downvoted for above lol. but Agreed, it probably won't be a meme stock either due to it's price, and often times these stocks have high prices because of the nature of the company. I simply wouldn't invest 700$ or 1400$ or more at a time since throwing that magnitude of money at a time can be difficult when you have other expenses to cover first.
