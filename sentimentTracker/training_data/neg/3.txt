> why would I spend $700 on a share when may are expecting a crash?

Many were also expecting a market crash on here in 2016 when it was under $100. Many were also expecting a market crash last Fall when I started buying in the mid $300's.  A lot of people probably missed buying a lot of great long-term winners (whether ASML or whatever else) over the last 5-10 years because of all the people who are oddly eager to indiscriminately proclaim "IMMINENT MARKET CRASH" and "UPCOMING BEAR MARKET" and then when they're wrong they say things like "not wrong just early" (can never be wrong then - just keep pushing back the goalposts.)

" I would consider buying it, but its difficult to spend that much money on a single or multiple shares."

Buy fractionals gradually over time, as others have noted.
