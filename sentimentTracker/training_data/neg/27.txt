Firstly your conclusion of a stock should stay the same unless some bad news come out about the company, if your down it doesnt matter because if you think its going to be $50 in 1-2 years than the 9.3% loss your in now. Also use this loss as a sign to double down as your buying at an even cheaper price and if it goes up you gain that loss back quicker. Secondly i would use this as a way make you stomach losses easier in the future because in any future position where your in the red you’ll remember how it paid off for palantir and you wont make a emotional decision. If you went and sold you’ll continue make the same mistake and always selling at a loss.
