Let’s start with Canoo’s product. Nobody wants it. They have 9,000 $100 deposits. Preorders opened six months ago and they only have 9,000. F-150 Lightning got almost 50,000 preorders in the first 48 hours. Tesla Cybertruck has nearly 1,000,000 preorders. The are literally building a product with no demand.

Canoo has $500 million and needs $565 million for its contract factory and $1 billion for its Pryor, OK mega-micropenis factory.

If you read the Canoo’s term sheet with its contract manufacturer, Nedcar, you see right away Nedcar is not going to hold Canoo’s hand. Canoo is paying for everything, is responsible for supplier quality, deliveries, setting up production lines. Nedcar is not going to take any responsibility if shit goes wrong, it’s all on Canoo. It also doesn’t matter to Nedcar how much these cost to manufacture, they are getting a predetermined margin that Canoo has to pay. On top of that it’s going to be HARD to manage a contract manufacturer and a production line that is 6,000 miles away.

The Pryor factory is in a town of 9,000 people and is 30 minutes away from the next biggest town which has a population of 18,000.  It’s literally nowhere. Who will want to move to that area? How will they get 2,000 qualified employees? There’s also only about 100-150 homes and lots for sale in Pryor.

The size of the factory also doesn’t make sense. 1 million sq ft is less than 1/5 the size of Tesla’s Fremont factory. Tesla’s Reno factory is 1.8 million sq ft. 

Tesla has 70,000 employees and Canoo plans on having 2,000? 

By Canoo’s own estimates they will be out of cash before they even start production at their contract manufacturer. How are they going to pay for their first 16,000 pod-like turds and how are they going to pay for their factory in the middle of nowhere?

BMW will never use Canoo’s platform.

Apple will never use Canoo’s platform.

You’re relying on false hope for some kind of partnership. It’s a mistake. Never believe your own bullshit.
