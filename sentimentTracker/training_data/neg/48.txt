Unless Amazon is broken up, those companies are gonna be squeezed hard by Amazon. Maybe get so battered and beaten that they just get acquired. 

I don't see either of them possessing the resiliency in the pharmacy space that, say, Walmart has in the retail space against Amazon. I'd say if you're not at least a Walmart-level contender, Bezos is gonna eat your lunch
