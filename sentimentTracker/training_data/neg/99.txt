>What the company continues to warn the market is that the future isn't getting better. Intel was able to sell more chips in Q2 due to shortages around the industry, but the company has no confidence this pattern will continue in the future as AMD takes server market share.

>The guidance assumes gross margins miss analyst estimates as the 59.2% rate in Q2 falls with a dip to 55.0% in Q3. With the Q1 gross margins up at 58.4%, the implied guidance has margins dipping to possibly as low as 53.0% in Q4. The number clearly has to fall below the Q3 margin rate to average 56.5% this year.

>The warning on the stock for years now has been this disappointing trend of business eventually declining. The stock has pretty much traded flat since 2018 due to this persistent weakness of the business.

>Investors must consider what happens the one quarter where Intel doesn't smash estimates. If sales actually dip 9% in Q4, the stock is highly unlikely to trade higher than the current price.

Takeaway

>The key investor takeaway is that investors must avoid Intel until the company figures out how to turn around the manufacturing business to produce next generation chips in a timely manner. The company is quickly heading towards a scenario where FCFs won't cover much more than the annual dividend payment as margins remain under pressure due to competition from the likes of AMD.

I remain invested but that was a bit disappointing quarter and I would understand it stock was dipping today. Lets hope Pat can turn this ship around.
