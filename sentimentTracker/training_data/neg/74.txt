The semiconductor sector is down quite a bit already over the past few days and it's been up and down quite a bit all year.

The way I track it (the SOXX), would need to drop at least another 5% before I'd even think about pushing in new money at this point. And given history with what happened last year after Apple and Tesla split, this sector can easily drop more than just 5%.
