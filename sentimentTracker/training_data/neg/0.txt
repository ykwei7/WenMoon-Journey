It’s incredible naive to think investors don’t know about ASML. Sure your average joe on the street might have never heard of them but all major tech investors are certainly aware of ASML. Also just because ASML has a monopoly and makes awesome technology doesn’t mean it’s share price will continue to grow. It’s PE ratio is already very high and there is no real reason to believe their earnings have alot of growth potential as they already have a monopoly in the market in which they operate and are already at maximum production capability. So in short, great company but probably already appropriately valued.
