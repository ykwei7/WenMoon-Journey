In theory the Luckin coffee, Didi etc risks are reduced. Frankly, all my Chinese etf or CQQQ etc have not done well.  I selected a US based etf in SF with 90% in Chinese insurance, Wechat etc. that did poorly lost -35% after staying with that etf paying 1.75% fee over 2 year period. That goes with internet or search engine stocks over several years.  I do better with US etf and similar stocks.
