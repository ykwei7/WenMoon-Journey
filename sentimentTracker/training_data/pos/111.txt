I looked up the company in the summer of 2016, few days away from announcing their 2nd quarter (or 3rd quarter) results. I had zero clue about investing then but had taken a class on accounting just before the summer break and was just passing time by looking at their income statements, analyst recommendations etc. 

It was the talk of the town that Amazon had been killing off traditional brick and mortar stores so, the future expectations were quite low for Best Buy too. But I remember they beat analyst expectations and kept on doing it quarter after quarter. I even vividly remember reading an article somewhere on how Best Buy had survived the Amazon effect. 

The stock was around $30 when I looked at it and the P/E around 15 which is the norm. Looked it up today and astonished that they are at $112 with a P/E of 13.5. It's quite impressive in my opinion. 

I haven't looked into the soft-side of the business away from financial numbers and neither have any interest in doing so but on surface, it seems like the Best Buy Management team had a winning formula all along.
