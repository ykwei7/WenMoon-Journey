Very true, TSLA is priced for perfection on the automotive front. But this is also a company that innovates and develops in ways that no one sees coming.  Base case, I expect car sales to keep booming for the foreseeable future (which is the forecast for at least the next 5 years and being proven quarter after quarter) that will justify current market cap...but Elon will have some surprises in store.  Think Tesla insurance, solar roof scaling, Tesla taxi, early access to Starlink for retail shareholders, energy grid/storage, and many others that are in the works.

I personally will never sell a share bc I believe in the company and the mission. I just keep adding a few each month.  I guess that's the biggest difference, when you believe in a company, you are less focused on short term share price and more so focused on the long term road map
