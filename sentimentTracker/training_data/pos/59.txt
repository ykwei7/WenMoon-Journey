very cool, always like to look at this when it's updated.  
  
That EM earnings growth on 55 seems pretty wild. I guess I didn't expect the small shrink in '20, and trying to piece together how consensus would be so high (e.g. if they are including SK or something). And then is China included in the EM, a bit confusing when they get broken out.  
  
At any rate, going to be real interesting following the growth of the middle class in India and China. That seemed like one of the many things that got violently paused, but hopefully not derailed.
