The #1 question that I ask myself whenever I'm considering buying stock in a brick and mortar business is: "Is this business Amazon-proof?"

Both of these companies fail that question since Amazon has strong plans of competing in their area of business and I expect Amazon to do quite well against them so I honestly wouldn't touch either of them at this time.

If I had to choose though, I would go with CVS since they seem to be putting more effort into expanding their business to other healthcare areas.
