Nobody understands this because they just look at the S&P which hasn't dropped and don't see anything underneath. Oil is getting absolutely killed and down over 10%. Financials are getting killed. Any cyclical stock is getting killed. In fact over 400 of the 500 names in the S&P were red yesterday, many have been red for awhile.

The money moves around, but it doesn't move out (and probably won't until the fed increases interest rates) so the index remains elevated while sectors go through corrections underneath.

And to keep it relevant, CRSR is a value play and a steal at these prices. But unlike other value plays it's still in a growth phase. WSB pumped the stock a few weeks ago and it sold off but the underlying company isn't at all a meme and has a very sturdy floor at around $30 - $31. It only recently dipped below that.
