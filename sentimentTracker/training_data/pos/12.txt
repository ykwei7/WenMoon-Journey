Good point!  Upvoted!  I usually look at stocks based on the fundamentals and not so much the face value of each share.  A stock that costs just a few dollars might be on its way down to zero value.  On the other hand, stocks like AMZN, BRK-A , BRK-B or ASML might look expensive but they are worth it.  With fractiional shares, they are accessible to everyone.  There are quite a few videos on YouTube about ASML.  You might want to check them out.  ASML is definitely not a meme stock, YET.  That makes it even more attractive before the mob start to bit it up.
