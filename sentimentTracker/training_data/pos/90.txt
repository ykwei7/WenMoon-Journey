I’m not going to spend anymore time on this since you’re just parroting headlines… but to be clear these are credits from other automakers for not being able to make cost effective EVs. They buy credits from Tesla in order to comply with emissions laws. 

Also money is fungible, you don’t just subtract parts of businesses you don’t like and then keep the investments/costs that a company makes based on that cash flow you just ignored. If Tesla didn’t have the extra money they would just invest / grow slower. 

The reality is that Tesla has some of the highest auto gross margins (21%+) in the industry even excluding credits.
