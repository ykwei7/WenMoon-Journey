It’s not that expensive. PEG 1.8. PE of 55. Seems reasonable for a monopoly with 32% revenue growth, 70% earnings growth with expanding margins. 28% cap ex to net income. 0.01% of net income on debt interest payments. Tons of free cash flow to buy back stock 2.7 bil in 3 years and pay a dividend which has doubled over last 3 years.
