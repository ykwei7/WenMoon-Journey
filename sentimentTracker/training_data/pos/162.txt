Ok earnings. Only problem is that all things considered, it should've been stellar. Guessing AMD will have good datacentre numbers. Luckily AMD is  my semiconductor stock.

INTC is cheap, and this could be a nice entry if they manage to fix their problems, but I'd rather bet on the underdog that's currently superior technology-wise.
