I disagree, if the elderly already order their goods on Amazon during the pandemic, what's to stop them from clicking a couple more buttons to get their medicine on the same app.  Besides as you get older it becomes more difficult to drive, walk, do errands, etc.  It becomes very nice to be able to just have your meds, mail, groceries, etc at your door step and you can get back to watching jeopardy, gardening, knitting, etc.

If you don't believe in Amazon, then I would buy Costco/Walmart/Target before I would buy CVS/Walgreens.
