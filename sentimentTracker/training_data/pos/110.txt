Things you’re missing:
- They have been retracting their sales footprint by closing stores and shrinking floor space. This is impeding their ability to grow to gain lower expense.
- Employee Sat is high at corporate functions due to profit sharing much lower down the ranks than most of their peers. Getting paid ‘extra’ always makes people happier.
- The previous CEO was widely loved and seen as the only reason they didn’t go under. Current leadership is likely still riding that high.
- Hands on price shopping: As you’ve said, lots of people want to touch and feel the product before they buy, however MANY will still go shop online for better prices and delivery after viewing the product. BBY does not offer competitive incentives to ‘stick with them’ to the register.
- Almost half of their business comes from PC and Phone related sales yet those usually take up less than 1/3 of a store footprint and this revenue stream has STRONG competition from large, online, and boutique solutions. With material supply chain constraints in play, BBY’s purchasing power may be less than their peers (a matter of fact and perception combined) which will likely result in more OOS events and lost sales to those who have inventory. This is IMO the largest risk for the next 2 years.
- Staffing: With the larger movement to increase staffing pay, and anemic margins to support increased pay, it’s very likely that staff will be lured away to other brick and mortar stores who can support such pay. This is especially true for places like Target and Walmart who offer competing products AND have more inelastic demand items like clothing, food, and home supplies which help during downturns.

I personally watch BBY, heck I’ve interviewed there, but I don’t own them due to the level risk present in the retail space and their position within it
