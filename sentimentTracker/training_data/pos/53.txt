I own uwmc stock, but I think both stocks have a lot of upside. Every time their earnings come out they seem to get a bump and with refinances skyrocketing again that means profit will be good for this quarter and next quarter. Also people are finally realizing this isn’t a bubble and more housing inventory is becoming available and the inflation fud is dying down.
