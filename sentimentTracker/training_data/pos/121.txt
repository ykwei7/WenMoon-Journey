First solar has been awesome for me, making me wish I bought more than 3 shares. I recently bought renewable energy group and it’s been a little down since I bought but I typically buy and hold for the long term (40-50 years). I’ve looked at bep but there is also bepc and bam which may be a better look due to tax implications or what you are looking for.
