Nothing is risk free but I like the odds on TSLA. They are so far ahead of legacy automakers (just look at the specs, it's a joke to compare) and the macro climate is so perfect for EVs to succeed. Its literally happening as you watch if you pay attention.  EV adoption is growing tremendously, laws are banning ICE cars starting in 2025 or 2030, clean energy America's act, giga Berlin, giga austin, there are so many catalysts. I'm not even banking on autonomous driving...if they achieve that, game over.  Even without it, TSLA will be a trillion dollar company within 5 years.  Tsla is my biggest holding and I fully expect to keep being handsomely rewarded for being a part of it
