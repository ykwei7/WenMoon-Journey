I'd rather the more diversified CVS if I had to (although Rosalind Brewer was a great get for Walgreens as CEO) but not really interested in either. I think people are going to places like Costco for cheaper Rx.

The Amazon threat will continue to have an impact but I gotta say, Amazon may be a fantastic tech company and a terrific logistics company, but I have yet to be convinced that Amazon is a good physical retailer. They've really done kind of a terrible job with Whole Foods. They're building Amazon Fresh stores but Whole Foods doesn't make one confident, nor does the fact that I don't really hear anything about the Amazon Go stores anymore. Can Amazon compete with CVS/Walgreens online? To some degree, sure but I'm less concerned about them competing as a physical retailer - and they'd probably have to build that out because I really don't see Amazon being allowed to buy anything at this point.
